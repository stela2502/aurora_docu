# aurora_docu
Aurora documentation from the eye of a bioinformatician


The documentation is created by using the python package MkDocs.
Once you clone this repo you can use the mkdocs program to build and deploy the web page.

```
mkdocs build
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

This will update [the public web page](https://stela2502.github.io/aurora_docu/) if I do it.
